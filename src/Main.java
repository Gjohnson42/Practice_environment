 * Created by Garrett on 1/21/2016.
 * This is meant to be the primary file to practice random stuff in Java, for the sake of learning it.
 * Make a seperate branch if you aren't sure what you're doing. This should be a chromebook based change.
 * I'll check at home whether or not github decided to freak out.

        //now to create the random numbers, which requires a casting to int. I could just tell it the lengths by hand
        //but that would make my code more brittle.
